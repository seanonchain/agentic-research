**Simple Agentic Researcher**

Starts with 1 topic from the user, and each iteration finds 3x more questions to answer through web research and papers. 

The agent adds the results to research.md, and starts a new iteration with 3x as many topics. 

At the end of 3 iterations, it summarizes research.md into summary.txt
